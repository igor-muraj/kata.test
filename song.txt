Innocent, that's my way
Don't know where I am
Catch my breath, can't think straight
Got to make a plan

But I get butterflies
Water in my eyes

'Cause I'm fragile when I hear your name
Fragile when you call
This could be the nearest thing to love
And I'm fragile when I hear you speak
Fragile, feeling small
This could be the closest thing to love
